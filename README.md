# Basic Machine-Learning Project on Titanic Dataset

This is a machine learning project that analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to predict the survival rate of passengers based on various features. The goal of this project is to build and compare several machine learning models to find the most accurate one.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community that contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. It has 891 rows and 12 columns, and it can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data).

## Requirements
The following Python packages are required to run this project:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Usage
To run this project, you can follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the required packages using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Open the main.ipynb notebook and run the cells to train and evaluate the models.
- Optionally, you can modify the notebook to experiment with different features or models.


## Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier

## conclusion
In this project, I analyzed the Titanic dataset and built several machine learning models to predict the survival rate of passengers. This project demonstrates the importance of feature engineering and model selection in machine learning.
